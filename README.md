# threejs-testing


## Dev workflow

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` (auto-compile TS bundle in watch mode + Vite live reload)
- `npm run typecheck` (TypeScript checks over TS sources)
- `npm run build:game` (compile TS back into browser runtime JS files)
- `npm run clean:js` (remove legacy per-file JS sources under `js/`)

TypeScript is configured in `tsconfig.json` with:
- `allowJs: false`
- `checkJs: false`
- `noEmit: true`

Runtime JS is emitted as a single bundle at `dist/game.bundle.js` via `tsconfig.bundle.json`, so `.ts` files are now the editable source of truth.

During `npm run dev`:
- TypeScript rebuilds `dist/game.bundle.js` automatically when `.ts` files change.
- Vite serves the app and triggers full-page reload when the bundle file changes.
